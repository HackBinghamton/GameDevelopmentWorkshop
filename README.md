# Game Development Workshop

## Getting Started

In this workshop, we'll be going over the basics of the Unity game editor. You'll learn how to use the editor to create your own game, by, well, creating your own game! Unity uses the C# programming language, so we have sections that go over the basics. It is recommended that you have some Object Oriented programming experience, but you can definitely try your hand at this workshop if you don't.

## Sections

These are all of the sections of the workshop. We recommend that you go over them in order, as each sections builds off the other. This entire tutorial is not short, but don't be discouraged. You can still learn so much from this workshop wit
