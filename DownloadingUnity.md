# Downloading Unity and Visual Studio

> "Oh god I'm so wide"		- Wide dog

Ok, so I know you can most likely figure this out on your own, but this way I know we are all on the same page. The goal of this particular guide is to get everyone on the same software as painlessly as possible. So hopefully this guide can save you a headache in the future and an hour looking through help and installation guides right now. 

Let’s start by downloading the Unity Hub. You can download Unity Hub Here: https://unity.com/unity-hub
This is where you will access/download your Unity versions and projects. 
Press this **Get Started** button to … get started

Then in the new window, make sure you are on the individual tab and click the button under personal. If you have the Github student developer pack, you actually get Unity Pro for free. If so, still use personal, you’ll just sign in with a pro account later.

Unity Pro has some nice collaboration features. But unless you are releasing a game and doing ads, or using their special diagnostic features, it’s really not necessary. 

In the next screen, scroll down and select the appropriate option for your platform. I don’t recommend the beta versions, but if you want to go for it.![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4e4AGtxEPvvXElICeWCenONWcruYbmKurld_Nct7owF6w8KeVesxKS7m9J-CHGypbD-4CC4QKfdf8MVfrTaOJC6OJWAYif8Sxp_tY722cEuSQge--nnahGPU1QSlvXtrKMh16jHhD5Kv)

This should give you the executable for installing Unity Hub. Go ahead and run it and follow the prompts. You should end up with this window.

Let’s start by creating an account. If you don’t have a Unity account, there is a link to make one.

You should now see your initials where the profile picture icon was. Now let’s get the license. Click on the settings wheel and go to Licence Management and select Activate New License. If you have the pro version from the Github Student Developer Pack, select Pro, otherwise select Personal.

You can pick whichever option you like. If you need to change it later, you can, just create a new license with the correct option for you. If you have a pro license, you will need the key to unlock it. If you log into Unity, you should be able to find it in your account settings. 

And now we have to download our editor version. You can generally switch between editors that are near each other pretty freely for projects that are simple like this one. But to try to keep things simple, it’d be best if everyone was using the same version.

Be sure to select Visual Studio as an add-on. Otherwise you will have to download it later, unless you already have or plan to use Visual Studio Code instead.		

The other add-ons are optional and if you need to you can add them later fairly easily. If you want to build an executable for your game, these are the options you should pick. If you are not planning on building it or the space requirements are getting hefty, feel free to skip it. Otherwise I suggest you pick the platform you are working on to start. For Windows, you can pick either, but the one below gives you everything you need for Windows 10 and is much smaller.

The download/install can take a while. Like a long while. A really long while. Unity and Visual Studio are both pretty buggy programs so don’t be surprised if it starts getting close to half an hour or more. Visual Studio will start downloading somewhere in the middle of the Unity download.
When you’re done it should look like this:

You may need to restart your computer before Visual Studio will open. You will also need to sign in to a Microsoft account to get into Visual Studio. Besides that, it may ask you what development environment you want. Generally C# is good. But it should open just fine.

And that’s all the installation you need. Or at least it should be. If you are doing VSCode instead of Visual Studio. There are likely a few more hoops you’ll need to jump through, like installing the C# syntax and maybe a Unity plugin. But it should work just the same if that’s more your thing.
